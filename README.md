Sample Graph Data Flow:
```
Remove stop words (stop words are common words with little meaning and removing will reduce noise in data while graphing)? Y/N
Y
Annotate Points with words? (with huge datasets, this could take a long time to render) Y/N
N
Minimum count for words to be plotted (numeric):1
